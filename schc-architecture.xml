<!--- (compiled with:  "kdrfc schc-architecture.md" ) -->

<t>The IETF LPWAN WG defined the necessary operations to enable IPv6 over
selected Low-Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN) radio technologies.
<xref target="rfc8376"/> presents an overview of those technologies.</t>

<t>The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) <xref target="rfc8724"/> technology is the core
product of the IETF LPWAN working group and was the basis to form the SCHC
Working Group.
<xref target="rfc8724"/> defines a generic framework for header compression and fragmentation,
based on a static context that is pre-installed on the SCHC endpoints.</t>

<t>This document details the constitutive elements of a SCHC-based solution, and
how the solution can be deployed. It provides a general architecture for a SCHC
deployment, positioning the required specifications, describing the possible
deployment types, and indicating models whereby the rules can be distributed and
installed to enable reliable and scalable operations.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="building-blocks"><name>Building Blocks</name>
<t>This section specifies the principal blocks defined for building and using the SCHC architecture in any network topology and protocol.</t>

<section anchor="schc-stratum-plural-strata"><name>SCHC Stratum (plural: strata)</name>

<t>A SCHC Stratum is the SCHC analoguous to a classical layer in the IP architecture, but its operation may cover multiple IP layers or only a subset of a layer, e.g., IP only, IP+UDP, CoAP, or OSCORE <xref target="rfc8824"/>. The term stratum is thus used to avoid confusion with traditional layers. Also, SCHC Strata are not stacked, though they can be nested.</t>

<t>The SCHC Stratum data in a datagram is composed of a SCHC Header (which may be compressed to the point that it is fully implicit and thus elided), a SCHC payload (that is used to uncompress a section of the SCHC datagram), and user payload that is unaffected by the SCHC Stratum. The SCHC Stratum operation requires 2 Instances, one for the SCHC Header and one for the SCHC payload.</t>

<t>A SCHC compressed packet may contain multiple stratum data, to be handled by sequential (nested) SCHC Strata, where the inner (nested) Stratum operates within the payload of the outter (nesting) Stratum.</t>

<!--
The SCHC operation concatenates fragments and swaps the stratum data with the uncompressed payload obtained from the SCHC packet residue. 
-->

<t>A SCHC Stratum is instantiated in participating nodes as a pair of SCHC Instances, and matching SCHC Instances in communicating nodes are associated to form a SCHC session. 
A SCHC Instance may be Point to point (P2P), or Point to Multipoint. 
A P2MP SCHC Instance is unidirectional, meaning that all the SCHC datagrams are generated by the same node. 
A P2P SCHC Instance may be unidirectional or bidirectional, symmetrical (between peers) or asymetrical (between a device and an application).</t>

<t>A SCHC Instance operates datagram fragmentation and/or data compression and decompression, and maintains the state and timers associated with the Stratum operation over the consecutive packets or fragments.</t>

<t>The SCHC end points that handle the compression for nested Strata might differ for the same packet, meaning that the payload of a given Stratum might be compressed/uncompressed by a different entity, possibly in a different node. It results that the degree of compression (the number of Strata) for a given packet may vary as the packet progresses through the layers inside a node and then through the network.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="discriminator"><name>Discriminator</name>

<t>The key to determine how to decompress a SCHC header in a stratum is called a Discriminator.</t>

<t>The Discriminator is typically extrinsic to the stratum data.</t>

<t>It may be found in the packet context, e.g., the ID of the interface, VLAN, SSID, or PPP session on which the packet is received.</t>

<t>It may also be received in the packet, natively or uncompressed from a nesting stratum, e.g.:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A source and destination MAC or IP addresses of the packet
carrying SCHC packets</t>
  <t>A source and destination port number of the transport layer
carrying SCHC packets</t>
  <t>A next header field</t>
  <t>An MPLS label</t>
  <t>A TLS Association</t>
  <t>Any other kind of connection id.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The Discriminator enables to determine the SCHC Instance that is used to decompress the SCHC header, called a SCHC Header Instance.</t>

<t>Once uncompressed, the SCHC Header enables to determine the SCHC Instance, called a SCHC Payload Instance, that is used to restore the packet data that is compressed in the stratum.</t>

<!--
A SCHC Layer is a building block composed at least of a SCHC Payload Instance as described in the {{rfc8724}}. A SCHC Header Instance may be added, it controls the SCHC Layer. The SCHC Header Instance is used with different SCHC Packets Instances if they are defined in the same SCHC Layer.

Note that a SCHC Layer is different from an ISO layer {{Fig-SCHCSESSION}}. 
-->

</section>
<section anchor="schc-header-instance"><name>SCHC Header Instance</name>

<t>The SCHC Header Instance manages the SCHC Headers and provides the information and the selection of a SCHC Payload Instance.</t>

<t>The rules for that Instance might be such that all the fields in the SCHC Header are well-known, in which case the header is fully elided in the stratum data and recreated from the rules.</t>

<t>The rules might also leverage intrinsic data that is found in-line in the stratum data, in which case the first bits of the stratum data are effectively residue to the compression of the SCHC Header. 
Finally, the rules may leverage extrinsic data as the Discriminator does.</t>

<!--
A SCHC Header is mandatory in a stratum and can be free of charge for very constrained networks such as LPWAN. It allows the recognition of SCHC as the next header and can give the protocol that SCHC has compressed.
-->

<t><xref target="Fig-SCHCSESSION"/> illustrates the case where a given stratum may compress multiple protocols sessions, each corresponding to a different SCHC Payload Instance.</t>

<!--
shows the SCHC strata that needs to be introduced in the Architecture when SCHC is used to compress different protocols together or independently as {{rfc8824}} has described for CoAP. Notice that the parenthesis in the figure indicates a SCHC compression.

<section anchor="schc-header"><name>SCHC Header</name>

<t>SCHC Header carries information taht is required for the SCHC strata operation. For example, it selects the correct Instance and checks the validity of the datagram.
There IS NOT always a RuleID if there is only one Rule for the SCHC Header, whose length is 0. The SCHC Header format is not fixed, and the SoR MUST have one or more Rules describing the formats. SCHC Header contains different fields.
For Instance, when the SCHC header may identify the next protocol in the stack, the format of the SCHC header takes the format as <xref target="Fig-SCHCHDR"/> shows.</t>

<figure title="Example of SCHC Header Format and the corresponding Rule" anchor="Fig-SCHCHDR"><artwork><![CDATA[
Non-compressed SCHC Header Format:
+- - - - - - +- - - - - - -+- - -+
| Session ID | Protocol ID | CRC |
+- - - - - - +- - - - - - -+- - -+

SCHC Header Compressed:
+- - - - -+- - - - - - - - - - +
| Rule ID | Compressed Residue |
+- - - - -+- - - - - - - - - - +

Rule uses to compressed the SCHC Header:
RuleID

|     FID    |FL|POS|DI| TV  |  MO  |     CDA   |
+------------+--+---+--+-----+------+-----------+

| SCHC.CRC   | 8| 1 |Bi|     |ignore| value-sent|
+------------+--+---+--+-----+------+-----------+


]]></artwork></figure>

<t>In this example the Rule defines:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A SessionID is 10 bits length and it is used to identify the SoR used for this instance of SCHC.</t>
  <t>A Protocol ID in 1-byte length giving the value send in the layer below the SCHC packet to identify the uncompressed protocol stack.</t>
  <t>And A CRC. The CRC field is 8 bits length and covers the SCHC header and the SCHC packet from error. When it is elided by the compression, the layer-4 checksum MUST be replaced by another validation sequence.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="Instances"><name>SCHC Payload Instance</name>
<t>SCHC Payload Instance is characterized by a particular SoR common with the corresponding distant entity.
The <xref target="rfc8724"/> defines a protocol operation between a pair of peers.
In a SCHC strata, several SCHC Instances may contain different SoR.</t>

<t>When the SCHC Device is a highly constrained unit, there is typically only one
Instance for that Device, and all the traffic from and to the device is
exchanged with the same Network Gateway. All the traffic can thus be implicitly
associated with the single Instance that the device supports, and the Device
does not need to manipulate the concept. For that reason, SCHC avoids to signal
explicitly the Instance identification in its data packets.</t>

<t>The Network Gateway, on the other hand, maintains multiple Instances, one per
SCHC Device. The Instance is derived from the lower layer, typically the source
of an incoming SCHC packet as a discriminator in the <xref target="Fig-SCHCSESSION"/>.
The Instance is used in particular to select the set of rules that apply to the SCHC Device, and the
current state of their exchange, e.g., timers and previous fragments.</t>

<section anchor="schc-payload"><name>SCHC Payload</name>
<t>When compressed, the SCHC Payload is composed of a RuleID followed by the content described in the Rule.
The content may be a C/D packet, a F/R packet, a CORECONF_Management or a Non Compressed packet.
As defined in the <xref target="rfc8724"/>, the SCHC packet for C/D is composed of the Compressed Header followed by the payload from the original packet.
<xref target="Fig-SCHCPacket"/> shows the compressed header format that is composed of the RuledID and a Compressed Residue, which is the output of compressing a packet header with a Rule.</t>

<figure title="SCHC Packet" anchor="Fig-SCHCPacket"><artwork><![CDATA[
C/D Compressed Packet:

<section anchor="schc-profiles"><name>SCHC Profiles</name>
<t>A SCHC profile is the specification to adapt the use of SCHC with the necessities of the technology to which it is applied.
In the case of star topologies and because LPWAN technologies <xref target="rfc8376"/> have strict yet distinct constraints, e.g., in terms of maximum frame size, throughput, and directionality, also a SCHC Instance and the fragmentation model with the parameters' values for its use.</t>

<t>Appendix D. "SCHC Parameters" of <xref target="rfc8724"/> lists the information that an LPWAN
technology-specific document must provide to profile SCHC fragmentation for that technology.</t>

<t>As an example, <xref target="rfc9011"/> provides the SCHC fragmentation profile for LoRaWAN networks.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="schc-operation"><name>SCHC Operation</name>
<t>The SCHC operation requires a shared sense of which SCHC Device is Uplink
(Dev to App) and which is Downlink (App to Dev), see <xref target="rfc8376"/>.
In a star deployment, the hub is always considered Uplink and the spokes are
Downlink. The expectation is that the hub and spoke derive knowledge of their
role from the network configuration and SCHC does not need to signal which is
hub thus Uplink vs. which is spoke thus Downlink. In other words, the link
direction is determined from extrinsic properties, and is not advertised in the
protocol.</t>

<t>Nevertheless, SCHC is very generic and its applicability is not limited to
star-oriented deployments and/or to use cases where applications are very static
and the state provisioned in advance.
In particular, a peer-to-peer (P2P) SCHC Instance (see <xref target="Instances"/>) may be set
up between peers of equivalent capabilities, and the link direction cannot be
inferred, either from the network topology nor from the device capability.</t>

<t>In that case, by convention, the device that initiates the connection that
sustains the SCHC Instance is considered as being Downlink, i.e. it plays the
role of the Dev in <xref target="rfc8724"/>.</t>

<t>This convention can be reversed, e.g., by configuration,
but for proper SCHC operation, it is required that the method used ensures that
both ends are aware of their role, and then again this determination is based
on extrinsic properties.</t>

<section anchor="schc-rules"><name>SCHC Rules</name>
<t>SCHC Rules are a description of the header protocols fields, into a list of Field Descriptors. The <xref target="rfc8724"/> gives the format of the Rule description for C/D, F/R and non-compression. In the same manner the SCHC Header and SCHc CORECONF_Management will use the <xref target="rfc8724"/> field descriptors to compress the format information.</t>

<t>Each type of Rule is identified with a RuleID. There are different types of Rules: C/D, F/R, SCHC Header, CORECONF_Management and No Compression. Notice that each Rule type used an independent range of RuleID to identify its rules.</t>

<t>A Rule does not describe how the compressor parses a packet header. Rules only describe the behavior for each header field.</t>

<t>A common rule representation that expresses the SCHC rules in an interoperable
fashion is needed to be able to provision end-points from different vendors
to that effect, <xref target="rfc9363"/> defines a rule representation using the
<xref target="rfc7950">YANG</xref> formalism.</t>

<t><xref target="rfc9363"/> defines a YANG data model to represent the rules. This enables the use of several protocols for rule management, such as NETCONF<xref target="RFC6241"/>, RESTCONF<xref target="RFC8040"/>, and CORECONF<xref target="I-D.ietf-core-comi"/>. NETCONF uses SSH, RESTCONF uses HTTPS, and CORECONF uses CoAP(s) as their respective transport layer protocols. The data is represented in XML under NETCONF, in JSON<xref target="RFC8259"/> under RESTCONF and in CBOR<xref target="RFC8949"/> under CORECONF.</t>

<t>As described in <xref target="rfc8824"/>, SCHC  combining several SCHC Instances.
The <xref target="rfc8724"/> states that a SCHC Instance needs the rules to process C/D and F/R before the session starts and that the SoR of the instance control layer cannot be modified. However, the rules may be updated in certain instances to improve the performance of C/D, F/R, or CORECONF_Management. The <xref target="I-D.ietf-schc-access-control"/> defines the possible modifications and who can modify, update, create and delete Rules or part of them in the instances' SoR.</t>

<t>As represented in <xref target="Fig-SCHCCOAP2"/>, the compression
of the IP and UDP headers may be operated by a network SCHC Instance whereas the
end-to-end compression of the application payload happens between the Device and
the application. The compression of the application payload may be split in two
instances to deal with the encrypted portion of the application PDU. Fragmentation
applies before LPWAN transmission layer.</t>

<t>This document defines a generic architecture for SCHC that can be used at any of these levels.
The goal of the architectural document is to orchestrate the different protocols and data model
defined by the LPWAN and SCHC working groups to design an operational and interoperable
framework for allowing IP application over constrained networks.</t>

<t>The <xref target="Fig-SCHCArchi"/> shows the protocol stack and the corresponding SCHC stratas enabling the compression of the different protocol headers.
The SCHC header eases the introduction of intermediary host in the end-to-end communication transparently.
All the SCHC headers are compressed and in some cases are elided, for example for LPWAN networks. The layers using encryption does not have a SCHC header in the middle because they are the same entity.
<xref target="Fig-SCHCArchiEx"/> shows an example of an IP/UDP/CoAP in an LPWAN network.</t>

<section anchor="the-static-context-header-compression"><name>The Static Context Header Compression</name>

<t><xref target="rfc8724">SCHC</xref> specifies an extreme compression capability based on a description
that must match on the compressor and decompressor side.
This description comprises a set of Compression/Decompression (C/D) rules.</t>

<t>The SCHC Parser analyzes incoming packets and creates a list of fields that it
matches against the compression rules.
The rule that matches is used to compress the packet, and the rule
identifier (RuleID) is transmitted together with the compression residue to the decompressor.
Based on the RuleID and the residue, the decompressor can rebuild the original packet and forward it in its uncompressed form over the Internet.
When no Rule matches the header, the No Compression Rule is used.
When several Rules match the header the implementation must choose one.
How it is done or based on which parameters is out of the scope of this document. SCHC compresses datagrams and there is no notion of flows.</t>

<t><xref target="rfc8724"/> also provides a Fragmentation/Reassembly (F/R) capability to cope
with the maximum and/or variable frame size of a Link, which is extremely constrained in the
case of an LPWAN network.</t>

<t>If a SCHC-compressed packet is too large to be sent in a single Link-Layer PDU,
the SCHC fragmentation can be applied on the compressed packet.
The process of SCHC fragmentation is similar to that of compression;
the fragmentation rules that are programmed for this Device are checked to find
the most appropriate one, regarding the SCHC packet size, the link error rate,
and the reliability level required by the application.</t>

<t>The ruleID allows to determine if it is a compression or
fragmentation rule or any other type of Rule.</t>

<section anchor="schc-over-network-technologies"><name>SCHC over Network Technologies</name>

<t>SCHC can be used in multiple environments and multiple protocols.
It was designed by default to work on native MAC frames with LPWAN technologies such as LoRaWAN<xref target="rfc9011"/>, IEEE std 802.15.4 <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lo-schc-15dot4"/>, and SigFox<xref target="rfc9442"/>.</t>

<t>To operate SCHC over Ethernet, IPv6, and UDP, the definition of, respectively, an Ethertype, an IP Protocol Number, and a UDP Port Number are necessary, more in <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-schc-protocol-numbers"/>. In either case, there's a need for a SCHC header that is sufficient to identify the SCHC peers (endpoints) and their role (device vs. app), as well as the session between those peers that the packet pertains to.</t>

<t>In either of the above cases, the expectation is that the SCHC header is transferred in a compressed form. This implies that the rules to uncompress the header are well known and separate from the rules that are used to uncompress the SCHC payload. The expectation is that for each stratum, the format of the SCHC header and the compression rules are well known, with enough information to identify the session at that stratum, but there is no expectation that they are the same across strata.</t>

<section anchor="schc-over-ppp"><name>SCHC over PPP</name>

<t>The LPWAN architecture (<xref target="Fig-LPWANnetarch"/>) generalizes the model to any kind of peers.
In the case of more capable devices, a SCHC Device may maintain more than one Instance with the same peer, or a set of different peers.
Since SCHC does not signal the Instance in its packets, the information must be
derived from a lower layer point to point information.
For instance, the SCHC Instance control can be associated one-to-one with a tunnel, a TLS session, or a TCP or a PPP connection.</t>

<t>For instance, <xref target="I-D.ietf-schc-over-ppp"/> describes a type of deployment where
the C/D and/or F/R operations are performed between peers of equal capabilities
over a PPP <xref target="rfc2516"/> connection. SCHC over PPP illustrates that with SCHC,
the protocols that are compressed can be discovered dynamically and the
rules can be fetched on-demand using CORECONF messages Rules, ensuring that the peers use the exact same set of rules.</t>

<t>In that case, the SCHC Instance is derived from the PPP connection. This
means that there can be only one Instance per PPP connection, and that all the
flow and only the flow of that Instance is exchanged within the PPP connection.
As discussed in <xref target="EndPoints"/>, the Uplink direction is from the node that
initiated the PPP connection to the node that accepted it.</t>

<section anchor="schc-over-ipv6"><name>SCHC over IPv6</name>
<t>In the case of IPv6, the expectation is that the Upper Layer Protocol (ULP) checksum can be elided in the SCHC compression of the ULP,
because the SCHC header may have its own checksum that protects both the SCHC header and the whole ULP, header and payload.</t>

<t>The SCHC Header between IPv6 and the ULP is not needed because of the Next Header field on the IPv6 header format.

<t>In the air, both the SCHC header and the ULP are compressed.
The session endpoints are typically identified by the source and destination IP addresses. If the roles are well-known, then the endpoint information can be elided and deduced from the IP header.
If there is only one session, it can be elided as well, otherwise a rule and residue are needed to extract the session ID.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="schc-over-udp"><name>SCHC over UDP</name>
<t>When SCHC operates over the Internet, middleboxes may block packets with a next header that is SCHC. To avoid that issue, it would be desirable to prepend a UDP header before the SCHC header as shown in figure <xref target="Fig-SCHC_hdr2"/>.</t>

<t>In that case, the destination port can indicate SCHC as in an header chain, and the source port can indicate the SCHC session in which case it can be elided in the compressed form of the SCHC header.
The UDP checksum protects both the SCHC header and the whole ULP, so the SCHC and the ULP checksums can both be elided.
In other words, in the SCHC over UDP case, the SCHC header can be fully elided, but the packet must carry the overhead of a full UDP header.

<t>Typically, an LPWAN network topology is star-oriented, which means that all
packets between the same source-destination pair follow the same path from/to a
central point. In that model, highly constrained Devices (Dev) exchange
information with LPWAN Application Servers (App) through a central Network
Gateway (NGW), which can be powered and is typically a lot less constrained than
the Devices.
Because Devices embed built-in applications, the traffic flows to be compressed
are known in advance and the location of the C/D and F/R functions
(e.g., at the Dev and NGW), and the associated rules, can be pre provisioned in the system before use.</t>

<section anchor="schc-device-lifecycle"><name>SCHC Device Lifecycle</name>
<t>In the context of LPWANs, the expectation is that SCHC rules are associated with a
physical device that is deployed in a network. This section describes the actions
taken to enable an automatic commissioning of the device in the network.</t>

<section anchor="device-development"><name>Device Development</name>

<t>The expectation for the development cycle is that message formats are documented as a data model that is used to generate rules. Several models are possible:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>In the application model, an interface definition language and binary communication protocol such as Apache Thrift is used, and the parser code includes the SCHC operation.
This model imposes that both ends are compiled with the generated structures and linked with generated code that represents the rule operation.</t>
  <t>In the device model, the rules are generated separately. Only the device-side code is linked with generated code. The Rules are published separately to be used by a generic SCHC engine that operates in a middle box such as a SCHC gateway.</t>
  <t>In the protocol model, both endpoint generate a packet format that is imposed by a protocol.
In that case, the protocol itself is the source to generate the Rules. Both ends of the SCHC compression are operated in middle boxes, and special attention must be taken to ensure that they operate on the compatible SoR, basically the same major version of the same SoR.</t>

<t>In the device model and in the protocol model, at least one of the endpoints must obtain the SoR dynamically. The expectation is that the SoR are published to a reachable repository and versionned (minor, major). Each SoR should have its own Uniform Resource Names (URN) <xref target="RFC8141"/> and a version.</t>

<t>The SoR should be authenticated to ensure that it is genuine, or obtained from a trusted app store.

<t>The device and the network should mutually authenticate themselves. The autonomic approach <xref target="RFC8993"/> provides a model to achieve this at scale with zero touch, in networks where enough bandwidth and compute are available.
In highly constrained networks, one touch is usually necessary to program keys in the devices.</t>

<t>The initial handshake between the SCHC endpoints should comprise a capability exchange whereby URN and the version of the SoR are obtained or compared.
SCHC may not be used if both ends can not agree on an URN and a major version.<br />
Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUD) <xref target="RFC8520"/> may be used for that purpose in the device model.</t>

<t>Upon the handshake, both ends can agree on a SoR, their role when the rules are asymmetrical, and fetch the SoR if necessary. Optionally, a node that fetched a SoR may inform the other end that it is reacy from transmission.</t>

thus critical to ensure that the rules are distributed in a fashion that is

    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation (SCHC) framework, which provides both a header compression mechanism and an optional fragmentation mechanism. SCHC has been designed with Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) in mind.</t>
      <t>SCHC compression is based on a common static context stored both in the LPWAN device and in the network infrastructure side. This document defines a generic header compression mechanism and its application to compress IPv6/UDP headers.</t>
      <t>This document also specifies an optional fragmentation and reassembly mechanism. It can be used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over the LPWAN technologies. Fragmentation is needed for IPv6 datagrams that, after SCHC compression or when such compression was not possible, still exceed the Layer 2 maximum payload size.</t>
      <t>The SCHC header compression and fragmentation mechanisms are independent of the specific LPWAN technology over which they are used. This document defines generic functionalities and offers flexibility with regard to parameter settings and mechanism choices. This document standardizes the exchange over the LPWAN between two SCHC entities. Settings and choices specific to a technology or a product are expected to be grouped into profiles, which are specified in other documents. Data models for the context and profiles are out of scope.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines how to compress Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) headers using the Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation (SCHC) framework. SCHC defines a header compression mechanism adapted for Constrained Devices. SCHC uses a static description of the header to reduce the header's redundancy and size. While RFC 8724 describes the SCHC compression and fragmentation framework, and its application for IPv6/UDP headers, this document applies SCHC to CoAP headers. The CoAP header structure differs from IPv6 and UDP, since CoAP uses a flexible header with a variable number of options, themselves of variable length. The CoAP message format is asymmetric: the request messages have a header format different from the format in the response messages. This specification gives guidance on applying SCHC to flexible headers and how to leverage the asymmetry for more efficient compression Rules.</t>

	 <t>   A framework called Static Context Header Compression and
   fragmentation (SCHC) has been designed with the primary goal of
   supporting IPv6 over Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies
   [RFC8724].  One of the SCHC components is a header compression
   mechanism.  If used properly, SCHC header compression allows a
   greater compression ratio than that achievable with traditional
   6LoWPAN header compression [RFC6282].  For this reason, it may make
   sense to use SCHC header compression in some 6LoWPAN environments,
   including IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  This document specifies how a
   SCHC-compressed packet can be carried over IEEE 802.15.4 networks.
   The document also enables the transmission of SCHC-compressed UDP/
   CoAP headers over 6LoWPAN-compressed IPv6 packets.

      <t>This memo specifies a component-based architecture for Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUDs). The goal of MUD is to provide a means for end devices to signal to the network what sort of access and network functionality they require to properly function. The initial focus is on access control. Later work can delve into other aspects.</t>
      <t>This memo specifies two YANG modules, IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP options, a Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) TLV, a URL, an X.509 certificate extension, and a means to sign and verify the descriptions.</t>
